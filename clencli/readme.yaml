  name: Cloud Engineer CLI
  function: A CLI built to assist Cloud Engineers.
  id: clencli
usage: |-
  CLENCLI enables you to quickly and predictably create, change, and improve your cloud projects by automating common tasks such as creating a new project, or updating its documentation.

  ### Create a new project
  ```
    $ clencli init project --name moon
    $ tree -a moon/
    moon/
    ├── .gitignore
    └── clencli
        ├── readme.tmpl
        └── readme.yaml
  ```
  ### Create a new CloudFormation project
  ```
  $ clencli init project --name sun --type cloudformation
  $ tree -a sun/
    sun/
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── clencli
    │   ├── hld.tmpl
    │   ├── hld.yaml
    │   ├── readme.tmpl
    │   └── readme.yaml
    └── cloudformation
        ├── environments
        │   ├── dev
        │   └── prod
        └── templates
  ```
  ### Create a new Terraform project
  You can see a Terraform project/module generated as an example [here](https://github.com/awslabs/clencli/tree/examples/a-simple-terraform-project/examples/a-terraform-project).
  ```
  $ clencli init project --name mars --type terraform
  $ tree -a mars/
  mars/
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── LICENSE
  ├── Makefile
  ├── clencli
  │   ├── hld.tmpl
  │   ├── hld.yaml
  │   ├── readme.tmpl
  │   └── readme.yaml
  ├── environments
  │   ├── dev.tf
  │   └── prod.tf
  ├── main.tf
  ├── outputs.tf
  └── variables.tf
  ```
  ## Renders a template
  ```
  clencli init project --name jupiter
  cd jupiter/
  clencli render template
  Template readme.tmpl rendered as README.md.
  ```
  This `README.md` was generated and it's maintained by `CLENCLI` itself. You can check [readme.yaml](clencli/readme.yaml) for more details.
installing: Download the latest version [released](https://github.com/awslabs/clencli/releases)
  according to your platform and execute it directly. I recommend placing the binary
  into your `$PATH`, so it's easily accessible.
