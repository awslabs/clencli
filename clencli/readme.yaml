  function: A CLI built to assist Cloud Engineers.
  id: clencli
usage: |-
  CLENCLI enables you to quickly and predictably create, change, and improve your cloud projects by automating common tasks such as creating a new project, or updating its documentation.
  Modern software projects are composed of many repositories, and often worked upon by many development teams. Keeping consistency across the project is key to enable productivity and efficiency.

  In a polyglot world where a team can choose it's programming language, often this flexibility can spill into chaos as every repo looks different. CLENCLI solves this issue by giving developers a quick and easy way to create a standardised repo structure and easily rendering documentation via a YAML file.

  ### Create a new project
  ```
    $ clencli init project --name moon
    $ tree -a moon/
    moon/
    ├── .gitignore
    └── clencli
        ├── readme.tmpl
        └── readme.yaml
  ```

  ### Create a new CloudFormation project

  ```
  $ clencli init project --name sun --type cloudformation
  $ tree -a sun/
    sun/
    ├── README.md
    ├── clencli
    │   ├── hld.tmpl
    │   ├── hld.yaml
    │   ├── readme.tmpl
    │   └── readme.yaml
    ├── environments
    │   ├── dev
    │   └── prod
    ├── nested.yaml
    └── stack.yaml
  ```
  You can see a CloudFormation stack generated as an example [here](https://github.com/awslabs/clencli/tree/examples/a-cloudformation-project/examples/a-cloudformation-project). Optionally, you may want to generate its High Level Design document, you can find an example for this project [here](https://github.com/awslabs/clencli/blob/examples/a-cloudformation-project/examples/a-cloudformation-project/HLD.md).

  ### Create a new Terraform project

  ```
  $ clencli init project --name mars --type terraform
  $ tree -a mars/
  mars/
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── LICENSE
  ├── Makefile
  ├── clencli
  │   ├── hld.tmpl
  │   ├── hld.yaml
  │   ├── readme.tmpl
  │   └── readme.yaml
  ├── environments
  │   ├── dev.tf
  │   └── prod.tf
  ├── main.tf
  ├── outputs.tf
  └── variables.tf
  ```
  You can see a Terraform project/module generated as an example [here](https://github.com/awslabs/clencli/tree/examples/a-terraform-project/examples/a-terraform-project). Optionally, you may want to generate its High Level Design document, you can find an example for this project [here](https://github.com/awslabs/clencli/blob/examples/a-terraform-project/examples/a-terraform-project/HLD.md).

  ## Renders a template
  ```
  clencli init project --name jupiter
  cd jupiter/
  clencli render template
  Template readme.tmpl rendered as README.md.
  ```

  This `README.md` was generated and it's maintained by `CLENCLI` itself. You can check [readme.yaml](clencli/readme.yaml) for more details. Every time the `README.md` is updated, a new photo is chosen for the project automatically.
installing: Download the latest version [released](https://github.com/awslabs/clencli/releases)
  according to your platform and execute it directly. I recommend placing the binary
  into your `$PATH`, so it's easily accessible.
